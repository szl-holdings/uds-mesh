# CANONICAL — this repository is the home of the UDS mesh

> **ADR-0001 AMENDMENT (2026-07-17):** This repository (`szl-otel-mesh`,

**`szl-holdings/uds-mesh` is the single canonical home of the UDS mesh.**

This is the authoritative source of record per **ADR-0001 (Canonical Home for the
UDS Mesh, ACCEPTED 2026-06-03)**.

## Why this is canonical

- It is a **real repository with real history** — multi-commit lineage, the mesh
  SDKs (`mesh/sdk/`), the 33-test conformance suite, the 5-organ span schemas, and
  the DSSE receipt layers (`formula_receipts.py`, `pinn_dsse.py`).
- It carries a **green Tests Gate + DCO** on `main`.
- Folding it into another repo mid-flight would be a **destructive merge**; keeping
  it canonical is the lowest-blast-radius, most honest choice.

## What this supersedes

A copy of these files exists at `szl-holdings/uds-bundles/mesh/`. That copy is
**non-canonical** and is being demoted to a thin pointer back to this repository.
A prior `uds-bundles/mesh/README.md` claimed the mesh was "absorbed into
szl-fleet-overlay / ARCHIVED" — **that claim was false** and is corrected by the
companion PR `chore/uds-mesh-pointer` on `uds-bundles`.
